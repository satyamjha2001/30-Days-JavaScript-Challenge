# Day 1: Variables and Data Types

## [Tasks/Activities:](./activity/)

### [Activity 1: Variable Declaration](./activity/1VariableDeclaration.js)
🔢 **Task 1:** Declare a variable using `var`, assign it a number, and log the value to the console.

📝 **Task 2:** Declare a variable using `let`, assign it a string, and log the value to the console.

### [Activity 2: Constant Declaration](./activity/2ConstantDeclaration.js)
✔️ **Task 3:** Declare a variable using `const`, assign it a boolean value, and log the value to the console.

### Activity 3: [Data Types](./activity/3DataTypes.js)
🔍 **Task 4:** Create variables of different data types (number, string, boolean, object, array) and log each variable's type using the `typeof` operator.

### [Activity 4: Reassigning Variables](./activity/4ReassigningVariables.js)
🔄 **Task 5:** Declare a variable using `let`, assign it an initial value, reassign a new value, and log both values to the console.

### [Activity 5: Understanding `const`](./activity/5UnderstandingConst.js)
🚫 **Task 6:** Try reassigning a variable declared with `const` and observe the error.

## [Feature Request:](./feature%20request/)

### [📜 Variable Types Console Log](./feature%20request/1VarTypeLog.js)
Write a script that declares variables of different data types and logs both the value and type of each variable to the console.

### [🔄 Reassignment Demo](./feature%20request/2ReassignmentDemo.js)
Create a script that demonstrates the difference in behavior between `let` and `const` when it comes to reassignment.

- 🔍 Understand the different data types in JavaScript.
- 🛠️ Be able to use the `typeof` operator to identify the data type of a variable.
- 🔄 Understand the concept of variable reassignment and the immutability of `const` variables.
